# EVA AI Interviewer Architecture

EVA (Enhanced Virtual Assistant) is an AI-powered interview system that conducts automated interviews with candidates. The system consists of three main components:

## System Overview

![EVA System Architecture](/images/EvaServer.png)

The EVA system is built on a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **EVA Server** - FastAPI-based server that handles interview room creation and management
2. **Container Manager** - Orchestrates EVA bot containers
3. **EVA Bot** - The AI interviewer that conducts the actual interview

## Component Details

### 1. EVA Server

The EVA Server is a FastAPI application that serves as the main entry point for the system. It handles:

- Interview room creation and management
- Authentication and authorization
- Interview status tracking
- Integration with external services

Key features:
- RESTful API endpoints for room management
- Token-based authentication
- Integration with Daily.co for video conferencing
- AWS S3 integration for storing interview data

### 2. Container Manager

The Container Manager is responsible for orchestrating EVA bot containers. It:

- Manages the lifecycle of interview bot containers
- Handles container resource allocation
- Provides health monitoring and status updates
- Supports both ECR and local container images

Key features:
- Docker container management
- Automatic container cleanup
- Health check endpoints
- Error handling and logging

### 3. EVA Bot

The EVA Bot is the AI interviewer that conducts the actual interview. It:

- Handles real-time audio/video communication
- Processes candidate responses
- Generates interview questions
- Creates interview reports

Key features:
- Real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- Natural language processing
- Interview transcript generation
- Automated report generation
- Integration with LLM services (Anthropic, OpenAI)

## Data Flow

1. Client requests an interview session
2. EVA Server creates a room and generates tokens
3. Container Manager spins up an EVA Bot container
4. EVA Bot connects to the room and conducts the interview
5. Interview data is stored in AWS S3
6. Reports are generated and sent to the client

## Integration Points

The system integrates with several external services:

- **Daily.co** - Video conferencing platform
- **AWS S3** - Storage for interview data
- **AWS ECR** - Container registry
- **LLM Services** - AI model providers
- **TTS Services** - Text-to-speech providers

## Security

The system implements several security measures:

- API token authentication
- Secure container management
- Encrypted data storage
- Secure communication channels

## Monitoring and Logging

Each component implements comprehensive logging:

- Request/response logging
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Container health checks

## Deployment

The system is designed for cloud deployment with:

- Containerized components
- Scalable architecture
- Load balancing support
- Automated deployment pipelines
